Dear {name},

For Lab 9, we have a setup a cluster on EC2 which is running a small Spark
cluster and IPython notebooks.

For this lab, you will connect the following IPython notebook server,
which is password protected. Note that this since this is over HTTPS (because
we don't want to send the password in the clear), you will have to go through
a browser warning about a self-signed certificate.

The URL of your notebook is:

https://{hostname}:8888/

The password is: {password}

Thanks,
- CS194-16 Course Staff
